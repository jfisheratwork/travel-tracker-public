# Session Summary - 2026-02-08 Session 2

**Date and Time:** 2026-02-08 16:05
**Objectives:** Synchronize with main branch, commit a new sample backup data file, and rename PROJECT_RULES.md to AGENTS.md.

## Key Changes
- Synchronized workspace with upstream `main`.
- Added `docs/examples/Travel_Tracker_Backup_2026-02-08.json`.
- Renamed `PROJECT_RULES.md` to `AGENTS.md` for better clarity on AI governance.

## Decisions and Rationale
- Creating a fresh branch to cleanly add the new sample data file after the previous PR was merged.
- Adhering to the new "External Command Security" and "Attribution" rules.
